## Description:
This projectâ€™s goal was to create a password generator website that provides the user the option to choose what type of password they want.

## Functionality
When the user clicks the button to generate a password a series of prompts for password criteria is presented:
    -how many characters would you like your password to have?  Please choose an number between 8 and 128
    -Would you like lowercase characters in your password?
    -Would you like uppercase characters in your password?
    -Would you like special characters in your password?
    -Would you like numbers in your password?

After the User correspond to all the prompts correctly the passwword is generated and persented in the Web page box ID: "#generate".

Case the user inputs an "number < 8 || > 128" to the first prompt presented and the alert "Please choose an number between 8 and 128" is shown.

Case the user inputs an charachter that is not a Number(isNAN) than the alert is shown:"Please choose an number"
